    <center><p> I made this piece as a catharsis. I needed to purge a lot of negative of emotions I was dealing with after I was suddenly ghosted by a very close of mine. It catapaulted my depression into an all-time and I have felt so unstable that. The process it took to make this was very painstaking and I did hours of researching ways to animate my page. I finally gave up and realized that my page was great the way it was. The same way I am looking at myself. I keep trying add all these unneeded things to try and make my page beautiful when it looked good the way it was. I see creating this project as a time vault. I want to come back to this page in a few years and see how I have changed as a person.</p></center>
